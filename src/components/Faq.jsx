                     <button className="accordion">What are Unlisted Shares?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>Shares which are not listed with any nationalised stock exchange (like NSE, BSE, etc.) are known as Unlisted Shares. Moreover, they are not traded publicly as they are not published on any stock exchange. Some of the famous unlisted companies in India are: PayTM, Fino PayTech, HDB Financial services, Swiggy and the list is exhaustive.</p>
                     </div>
                     <button className="accordion">Why Unlisted Shares?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>Because of their lower base, many start-ups are growing much faster than the older generation companies and they continue to outperform the benchmark returns significantly. Much of this development, however, happens before the firm goes public with an IPO. Hence investing in the Growth / Pre IPO stage in these companies will provide the investor with early- mover advantage resulting in superior returns. </p>
                         <p>We fulfil the intrinsic need of the buyers for a safe platform that gives them access to high-quality shares at the best price, provide trade matching and even allows retail purchases. Moreover, it is very easy and economical to buy stocks in these start-ups & private companies just as venture capitalists do without spending huge money.</p>

                     <button className="accordion">How to choose Unlisted shares yourself?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>The factors to be considered while choosing Unlisted Shares of a company are:</p>
                         <p>Probability of the share getting listed in the nearby future</p>
                         <p>Value of the stock</p>
                         <p>Competitors Analysis</p>
                         <p>However, we recommend all investors to consult their Financial advisors prior to decision making. </p>

                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>The process is as easy as placing an order at any e-commerce platform by entering few details such as: </p>
                         <p>Photo</p>
                         <p>Aadhar Number</p>

                     <button className="accordion">What are the advantages of Unlisted Shares?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>High value investments: Since the stocks are not quite liquid, they are mostly either undervalued or overvalued for long periods. So this situation offers opportunity to an investor to invest when the stock is undervalued thereby fetching n good returns on their investments.</p>
                         <p>Peace of mind: Unlike listed equity shares, unlisted equity stock prices are fairly stable and the investor need not worry about price volatility.</p>
                         <p>High growth investments: Most non-listed companies are smaller in scale and have yet to enter a point where they can go to the market to make use of funds for their capital needs. When the business is small, it often yields higher returns and when it gets listed on stock market, the investor generates faster unlocking of its intrinsic value.</p>
                         <p>Diversification of risk: Unlisted equity shares are unique asset class which provide some risk diversification for investors who are primarily invested in the listed stock markets.</p>
                     </div>
                     <button className="accordion">What is the downside of Unlisted Shares?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>Liquidity is one of the key challenges for shareholders of unlisted / Pre IPO shares.</p>
                         <p>Lock-in period of 1 year from the date of IPO launch. According to SEBI’s guidelines, the Unlisted shares can be sold in the market only after one year of IPO. </p>
                         <p>Dividends: Start-up and early stage businesses very rarely pay dividends because the companies usually redeploy their profits in the growth of business to build the shareholder value over a period of time.  </p>
                         <p>Dilution: If start-up’s go for additional funding at a later stage, more shareholders will come on board, reducing your percentage of holding in the company. Another reason for dilution in a business would be due to the grant of options available to employees of the investee company or to other service providers closely linked to the business. It is therefore important to continue to reinvest in the business, increasing your percentage of shareholding.  </p>
                     </div>
                     <button className="accordion">What is the future of Unlisted Shares?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>Unlisted stock market has been growing phenomenally and has substantially increased the wealth of investors of private companies in 2019</p>
                         <p>India’s IPO market has been buzzing for past few months of 2020. The primary market has a line-up of over 50 issues, with many still filing red herring prospectus with SEBI in preparation for market debut. HDB Financial, Studds, Kurlon and HDFC Securities are being tipped as potential candidates to hit the market soon.</p>
                         <p>Recent companies which have surged after listing include Bector Foods Happiest Minds, BVG India, Kannur Airport, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank, Digvijay Finlease, Suryoday Small Finance Bank, Deepak Industries, etc.</p>
                     </div>
                     <button className="accordion">What is the impact on Taxation?</button>
                     <div className="panel">
                         <p>LTCG on sale of unlisted shares is taxed at 20 per cent, while in case of short-term capital gains it is 30 per cent.</p>
                         <p>Income arising from transfer of unlisted shares would be taxed under the head ‘Capital Gain’, irrespective of period of holding.However, the government had introduced a TCS of 0.1% on sale of goods worth Rs 50 lakh and above with effect from 1st Oct 2019. This is virtually like STT (Securities Transactional Tax) for unlisted shares.
